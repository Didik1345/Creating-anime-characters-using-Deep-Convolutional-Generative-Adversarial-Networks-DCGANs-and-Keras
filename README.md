<h1 align="center">🎨 Creating Anime Characters with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) and Keras 🎨</h1>

<p align="center">
  This project uses Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) to generate high-quality, realistic anime character images by leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Through a competitive training process between a generator and a discriminator, DCGANs can create visually compelling images that closely resemble real-world data.
